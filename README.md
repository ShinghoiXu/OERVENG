## This is a creative coding project based on [p5.js](https://p5js.org/)<br>
## There are three different versions of this coding project:<br>
    1. OERVENG still "re-painting" copy by p5.js
    2. OERVENG "re-code" with sound sensitivity (microphone needed)
    3. OERVENG "re-code" with two different modes including "Mouse & Keyboard Mode" and "Sound Sensitivity Mode"
